# 📌 Project Context: Software Developer Portfolio

## 🏗️ Overview

This project aims to create an interactive and modern portfolio for a software developer. The website will be built using **Next.js**, ensuring performance and optimization, and will feature sophisticated animations and smooth visual effects to provide an engaging user experience.

## 🎨 Style and Design

The portfolio will be inspired by the design of [Devin AI](https://devin.ai/), adopting a **modern and minimalist style**, with interactive elements and subtle animations. The visual identity will be based on:

✅ **Elegant Minimalism:** Use of spacious layouts, sophisticated fonts, and a clean design.

✅ **Animation Effects:**
   - **Horizontal Scroll:** Smooth navigation between sections.
   - **Parallax Scroll:** Elements moving at different speeds while scrolling.
   - **Spline Light 3D Elements:** Lightweight and dynamic 3D elements for depth.
   - **Framer Motion and GSAP:** For smooth transitions and effects.
   - **Interactive Background:** Dynamic movements and subtle animations with particles or animated gradients.

✅ **Dark/Light Mode:** Automatic switching using `next-themes`.

✅ **Multi-Language Support:** Implementation of a toggle button for switching between **English** and **Portuguese**.

✅ **Advanced Interactivity:**
   - Elements reacting to cursor movements (dynamic hover effects).
   - Interactive buttons and sections that change smoothly when hovered over.
   - Responsive animations for intuitive navigation.
